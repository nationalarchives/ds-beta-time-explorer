## Iterations

### Iteration two

This [version](iterations/code/iteration_two) was developed in response to recommendations from user testing of the first iteration. It was then user tested with six participants in late January/early February 2021.  Recommendations from this [user testing report](user_research/iteration_two_user_testing_report.pdf) which relate to this the user experience are listed below.

#### User testing recommendations

##### Homepage

* As these were easier to read, chunk any time period descriptions into short and descriptive bulleted text.
* Provide multiple entry points for the archives. Consider: time, geography, subject, as
well as popular or trending content.
* Improve the copy at the top of the homepage:
    * To make the numbers easier to read round them and write them out. Instead of 24,218,562, write 24 million records.
    * So as not to confuse or mislead users, clarify that the archive holds
documentation about weapons, or weapons that compliment records.
    * Clarify what is actually available online: mention that 24 million records are physically held in the archives and 9 million are available to view on this website.
    * Refine the time period descriptions:
        * If possible add more context to the homepage bullet points, providing more
        explanation of key documents. If there isn’t space, provide an explanation on the next page.
        * Use clear and specific labels for the categories. Document types were easier
        to understand than broad categories.
        * Check that the most important records and events are the ones mentioned in the collection highlights on the homepage
        * Consider linking categories from within the time period descriptions on the
homepage to a related list of refined results within the time period.
* Review the homepage time period images and ensure they are representative of the time period and relate to the content described within the categories and collection highlights text.

##### Results page

* At a minimum organise content by date – left to right, or by relevance with the most important documents at the top. Next to the total number of records explain how the content is sorted. For example: 100,000 total records | Sorted by year ascending. For more refined prototypes consider providing users with more than one way to sort results.
* The thumbnail results page tested in Explorer 2.1 was better received.
    * Consider moving the filters to the right or left hand side of the page so there is more space vertically.
    * So support scanning and reading, the record ‘boxes’ could be condensed:
        * remove the year
        * shorten the title
        * remove the second title at the bottom.
* Use the same amount of space between record rows and columns, and possibly an amount somewhere between the two.
* Conduct further research to understand whether non-digitised content should be included.

##### Results page - categories and filters

* Consider testing alternative, smaller patterns for the filters.
* Generate a user-centred taxonomy for the archive. Test this independently to any Explorer prototype. Once a working taxonomy has been devised incorporate this into a future prototype and resume iterative testing. To test the explorer as a concept, a user-centred taxonomy could be limited to a portion of the archive, e.g. the medieval time period.
* Consider providing a short description to appear alongside filtered content to provide
users with further context.
* To maintain the archives reputation and authority, the results within a time period or category must be relevant. Only include results that fall within the time period and ensure that any record metadata that is shown within the results-set aligns with the time period. A 1888 Jack the Ripper letter should appear under the Victorian time period.

##### Results page - record thumbnail

Users will be unable to explore the archives unless we provide clear, concise and descriptive record titles. As long as titles are hard to understand and contain catalogue references, the archives will be perceived as for internal and expert use.

##### Details page 

The details page must include the option to view and download the document, if digitised. Further research should reveal what additional content must be included

### Iteration one

This [version](iterations/code/iteration_one) was the first produced within the Beta timebox for project Etna. It represented a significant revision of the [time explorer](/alpha_time_explorer.md) which was produced during the Alpha phase with many of the changes reflecting necessary accessibility and usability improvements. 

This version was user tested with six participants in December 2020 and recommendations from the [user testing report](user_research/iteration_one_user_testing_report.pdf) were taken forward into [iteration two](#iteration-two).

## User testing recommendations

### Testing of iteration two
