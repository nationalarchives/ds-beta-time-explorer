# Pre-sprint proposal 

## Approach

This prototype seeks to improve the Explore prototype by: 

* Leading the user through a process where **concepts and options are introduced in sequence** rather than all at once. This is based on an assumption that it will better serve the needs of new and novice users.
* **Presenting one idea or set of related choices per page**. It is hoped this will help new and novice users have a sense of progress and avoid feeling overwhelmed.
* **Emphasising the relationship between the user's action and the consequences of those actions**. This is so that the user has a clear sense of the _whole_ impact of their choices and the relationship between their current options and those that led to them. 
* Placing **greater responsibility on textual content to convey critical information**. This is on the basis that it will improve accessibility and afford us more flexibility when determining the best infographic approach at different screen resolutions.
* **Introducing a specialist view for 'highlights'**. This is on the basis that highlights are special and, while we can still present them interspersed withing 'normal' records, there is an argument for there to be an interface designed specifically for users that are interested only in the highlights from a given period or all time.
