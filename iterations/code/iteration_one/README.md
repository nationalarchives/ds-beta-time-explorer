# Converged Prototype: version 1

## Running this prototype:

1. Setup PHP on your computer
2. Run `php -S localhost:8000` from this folder in your terminal
3. Visit http://localhost:8000

Note that this was built for PHP 7 - PHP 8 is stricter, and therefore will produce errors when running the prototype.
