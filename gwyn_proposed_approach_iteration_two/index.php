                        <h2>Records are not evenly distributed</h2>
                        <p>
                            As you might expect, more records were created during and survive from recent centuries.
                            While we hold more than 100,000 records from medieval times the collection contains millions
                            that were created since the 1750s.</p>

                                    There is a general increase in the number of records as time progresses. For example, in the first one hundred years (between 974 and 1074) there are just 56 records in the collection, whereas there are approximately 242 thousand in the 1500s and 2 million records created since 1945.
